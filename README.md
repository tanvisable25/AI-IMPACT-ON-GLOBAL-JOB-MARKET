# AI-IMPACT-ON-GLOBAL-JOB-MARKET
🧠 Exploring How Artificial Intelligence is Reshaping the Job Market (2024–2030)
📌 Project Overview

The AIfluence Dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is influencing global employment trends.
Using Power BI, SQL, and Python, this project uncovers the impact of automation, emerging job roles, salary shifts, and education trends from 2024 to 2030.

The goal is to help policymakers, organizations, and job seekers understand:

Which industries are growing or declining due to AI.

Which roles face the highest automation risk.

How education level impacts salary and career security.

The evolution of job openings and remote work diversity in AI-driven careers.

🎯 Project Goals

Identify industries and roles most affected by AI.

Analyze fastest-growing industries from 2024 to 2030.

Assess automation risk levels across job categories.

Examine salary correlations with automation vulnerability.

Evaluate education level vs. salary trends in AI-driven jobs.

Explore gender diversity and remote work distribution in AI-related careers.

Predict job openings evolution by 2030.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Power BI	Dashboard development, data modeling, DAX calculations
SQL	Data extraction, transformation, and cleaning
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data preprocessing, visualization, and trend analysis
Excel / CSV	Initial data handling and import

🧠 Key Insights

Tech and Data Science industries are growing fastest, while manufacturing faces automation threats.

Highly skilled roles (AI Engineers, Data Scientists) show low automation risk and high salaries.

Bachelor’s & Master’s degrees yield significantly higher pay in AI-related sectors.

Gender diversity remains moderate, but remote work is increasing across industries.

Job openings projected to rise by 25–35% by 2030 in AI-augmented fields.

🪄 Python Components

Data Cleaning: Missing values, duplicates, and datatype fixes using pandas.

Visualization: Used matplotlib and seaborn for correlation plots and trend graphs.

EDA: Analyzed salary distributions, automation patterns, and education trends.

📘 Conclusion

The AIfluence Dashboard delivers actionable insights into how AI is transforming global employment.
By integrating Power BI (visual analysis), SQL (data management), and Python (deep analysis), this project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data-driven storytelling.
